# Code With Camille

To showcase my work I have created an application with informaiton about myself, a portfolio and "contact me" section. 


# Reactive Features
  -If you were to view it on a mobile device or Ipad the properties change in order to fit the screen.
 

# Links to previous work
  -When you hover over the picture of the Run Buddy Website it grows larger and a blue shadow appears indicating that you can click on it. 
  
  -When clicked you are brought to the live URL.
